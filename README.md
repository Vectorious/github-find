# github-find

A Chrome extension for searching within Github repos.

I love the Github shortcut for finding files in a repo by pressing 't', but there is no quick way to search file contents, and I was sick of downloading repos and opening them in Textmate just to do this.  When viewing a repository, a ![Github icon](https://github.com/afeld/github-find/blob/master/favicon.ico?raw=true) will appear in the address bar - press _CTL-SHIFT-f_ and a search box will appear.
